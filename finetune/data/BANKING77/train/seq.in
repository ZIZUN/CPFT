why did i only get $20 when i asked for $100?
the amount of cash i have received is not correct.
how can i get my money that i didn't get from the atm?
hi, today i have withdrawn cash from atm but i got wrong amount and in the app it is showing much more amount than that.
i didn't get all the money i asked for
the atm did not give me as much cash as i requested.
how can i request cash back? the atm just gave me a different amount than what i've been actually charged though...
why is my withdrawal wrong? i took out $100 but only received $20.
i only got some of the cash i requested from the atm
i am at the atm and tried to withdraw 30 pounds and it only gave me 10 pounds, what do i do?
i got the incorrect amount of money given to me from my account
i did not receive the correct amount of cash.
i did not receive all of my cash back
i got some cash but it wasn't the right amount.
can you explain why the atm is giving me less money than what i asked for?
i tried to withdraw 50 pounds but it only gave me 30. where is the rest of my money?
i visited the atm but got less money than what i requested. why?
i couldn't get the money i needed.
i made an atm withdraw it didn't give me the amount i asked for but is showing a withdraw for that amount.
so i just went to the atm to get some cash.  i input that i needed 100 pounds but i only got 80.  i have the receipt  and i am in need of the extra money.  how do i go about obtaining the missing amount?
the amount of money i pushed at the atm machine did not come out of the machine.
i got less than what i asked for in the atm, why?
i'm stuck here at your broken atm and i don't know what to do next. asked for 30 pounds, got 10. atm said i got 30. something very wrong here and i want my money now!
the machine only paid me a hundred when i wanted 20
